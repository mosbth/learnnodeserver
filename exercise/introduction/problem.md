# INTRODUCTION

Lets create a folder for this workshop, just to keep things organized. 

`mkdir $ADVENTURE_COMMAND`

Change directory into the `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND` folder:

`cd $ADVENTURE_COMMAND`

Create a file named `introduction.js`:

`touch introduction.js` or if you're on windows, `type NUL > introduction.js` (`type` is part of the command!)

Open the file in your favorite editor, and add this text:

```js
console.log('hello');
```

Save the file, then check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

`learnnodeserver verify introduction.js`
